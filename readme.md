# Automatic photo mover script
## Instructions
* Running the script will open a dialogue box asking for you to name the folder to move photos into. everything within the "srcfolder" path will then be moved to the "destfolder" path. Powered by DOS command prompt
## Goals
[x] Create a functional script

[x] Add support for counting and displaying the number of items found in the source path before they are moved

[x] Add a pause at the end of the script as to not alarm the end user if the command prompt closes suddenly

[ ] Reject input that does not include either a date or a command

[ ] Create a 'paths' option that opens a menu, which reveals both source and destination paths and allows you to modify one or the other based on your input.
    
    [ ]Also allow the user to navigate backwards through the menu by implementing a 'back' command
